Your job is to develop a comprehensive set of specifications and contracts for the Human Layer Daemon (hld).

HLD is a go process that interacts with a database, with claude code processes, with mcp servers over unix sockets

You will work off of SPECIFICATION_PLAN.md, which is a list of all tasks that are needed in order to generate the COMPLETE clearnroom specifications that can be used to implement from scratch.


0a. familiarize yourself with the code in hld/ and hlyr/

0b. familiarize yourself with specs/*

1. read @SPECIFICATION_PLAN.md and complete the single highest-priority specification task

2. SPECIFICATION_PLAN is a living document, update it with your progress when you are finished

3. use `git add -A` and `git commit -m "..."` to commit your changes - do not include any claude attribution

Remember you are creating the black-box specifications and contracts, you are not documenting implementation details.
